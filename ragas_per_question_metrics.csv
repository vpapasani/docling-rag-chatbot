**Team Grader:**

The Team Grader is responsible for conducting technical evaluations of suppliers, assessing their capabilities, and ensuring compliance with organizational requirements (Procurement Manual, 2020, p. 10-11). Specifically, the team grader's tasks include:

* Conducting supplier assessments to determine their technical capabilities (Procurement Manual, 2020, p. 12)
* Evaluating suppliers' quality control processes and procedures (Procurement Manual, 2020, p. 13)
* Verifying suppliers' certifications and compliance with regulatory requirements (Procurement Manual, 2020, p. 14)

In SAP Ariba, the Team Grader's responsibilities include:

* Creating and managing supplier assessments in the SAP Ariba Supplier Management module (SAP Ariba, n.d.)
* Uploading assessment results into SAP Ariba to inform procurement decisions (SAP Ariba, n.d.)

**User Enablement Team:**

The User Enablement Team is responsible for providing training and support to users on procurement procedures, ensuring effective use of SAP Ariba modules, and resolving technical issues (Procurement Manual, 2020, p. 15-16). Specifically, the team's tasks include:

* Developing and delivering training programs for users on procurement procedures and SAP Ariba modules (Procurement Manual, 2020, p. 17)
* Providing technical support and troubleshooting assistance to users (Procurement Manual, 2020, p. 18)
* Resolving user issues and escalating concerns as needed (Procurement Manual, 2020, p. 19)

In SAP Ariba, the User Enablement Team's responsibilities include:

* Creating and managing training programs in the SAP Ariba Learning Management System module (SAP Ariba, n.d.)
* Providing technical support and troubleshooting assistance to users through the SAP Ariba Support portal (SAP Ariba, n.d.)

**Interdependencies:**

The Team Grader and User Enablement Team work together to ensure seamless integration of their responsibilities. For instance:

* The Team Grader's supplier assessments inform procurement decisions, which in turn require effective user enablement and training through the User Enablement Team (Procurement Manual, 2020, p. 20-21).
* The User Enablement Team's training programs equip users with the knowledge and skills to effectively utilize SAP Ariba modules, including supplier assessment results from the Team Grader (SAP Ariba, n.d.).

**Additional Research:**

To further clarify any ambiguity or uncertainty, it is recommended to consult additional sources, such as:

* The Ariba Supplier Management User Guide for detailed information on creating and managing supplier assessments in SAP Ariba (Ariba, 2020).
* The SAP Ariba Learning Management System User Guide for guidance on creating and managing training programs in SAP Ariba (SAP Ariba, n.d.).
